- **Java**: Primary language.
- **Gradle**: Build tool.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building and running the REST API.

### Frontend

- **React**: UI library for building components.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for improved development experience.
- **react-router-dom**: Declarative routing library.
- **Spotify Web Playback SDK**: JavaScript library for integrating Spotify's player into the browser.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker**
   Make sure you have Docker installed.

2. **Spotify Developer Application**
   You need to register an application with Spotify:

   - Go to the [Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
   - Log in with your Spotify account.
   - Create a new app.
   - Under **Redirect URIs**, add:
     `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback`
   - Under **API/SDKs**, enable both:
     - Web API
     - Web Playback SDK

> **Note:** Unfortunately, a Spotify Premium account is required to play music in the browser using the Web Playback SDK.

### Setup

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zamora-carlos/SpotifyApp
  ```

- Navigate to project folder:

  ```bash
  cd SpotifyApp
  ```

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository following the structure of the `.env.example` file:

  ```bash
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
  SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback
  ```

### Running the project

- **Start the application**:

  The following command will start both the frontend and backend services:

  - Frontend: http://localhost:8080
  - Backend (API): http://localhost:9090

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- **Stop the application**:

  ```bash
